  _To every Child-flower that Blooms
     Within the Glorious Garden
         That we Call Home
         This Little Book
               is
        Lovingly Dedicated._




FOREWORD


  A flower, a child, and a mother’s heart—
  These three are never so far apart.
  A child, a flower, and a mother’s love—
  This world’s best gifts from the world above.

ALL children are flowers in the garden of God’s love. A flower is
the mystical counterpart of a child. To the understanding heart a
child is a flower and a flower is a child. God made flowers on the day
that He made the world beautiful. Then He gave the world children to
play amid the flowers. God has implanted in the breasts of children a
natural love for flowers—and no one who keeps that love in his heart
has entirely forsaken the land of childhood.

In preparing this book the author and the artist have attempted to
show the kinship of children and flowers—and it is their hope that
the little ones into whose hands this volume comes will find herein the
proof that their knowledge of what flowers really are is true and that
their love for the friendly blossoms is returned many-fold.

To you, then, little child-flowers, this book is lovingly offered as an
expression of thankfulness to children for the joy and sweetness with
which they have filled my life.

Flower Children

  SAID CROCUS: “My! this wind is cold!
  Most wish I had not been so bold;
  Here the fields are still all brown;
  Glad I wore my eider-down.”


[Illustration:]

  TRAILING ARBUTUS, you know,
  Loves to grow beneath the snow.
  Other folks would find it chilly,
  She says that’s absurdly silly.


[Illustration:]

  EAGER little Daffodil
  Came too soon and got a chill;
  Jack Frost pinched her ear and said,
  “Silly child, go back to bed.”


[Illustration:]

  HYACINTH, the pretty thing,
  Comes to us in early spring;
  Says she always loves to hear
  Easter bells a-ringing clear.


[Illustration:]

  LADY TULIP, stately dame,
  From across the ocean came;
  Liked this country very much,
  Although she only spoke in Dutch.

  In her new green tailored gown.


[Illustration:]

  PUSSY WILLOW said, “Meow!
  Wish some one would tell me how
  Other kittens get around
  And roll and frolic on the ground.”


[Illustration:]

  PRIMROSE is the dearest thing—
  She loves to play out doors in spring;
  But if a little child is ill,
  She’s happy on the window sill.


[Illustration:]

  GRANDFATHER Dandelion had such
    pretty hair,

  Along came a gust of wind and left his
    head quite bare;

  Young Dandelion generously offered hint
    some gold,

  To buy a cap to keep his dear old head
    from being cold.


[Illustration:]

  WIND-FLOWER on an April day,
  Came along and said she’d stay;
  Wore her furs snug as you please,
  Said she liked the nice, cool breeze.


[Illustration:]

  ANEMONES and Bluets grew,
  All the woodland pathway through;
  Came along one day together,
  Didn’t mind the April weather.


[Illustration:]

  I’m just as freckled as can be,”
  Her cousin Tiger-Lily said,
  “Well, look at me, I’m almost red.”


[Illustration:]

  With their little friendly faces,
  Always seem to smile and say:
  “How are all the folks to-day?”


[Illustration:]

  Said she really wished she could
  Have a pretty dress and go
  With sister to the flower show.

  Did n’t care to go and play,
  Rather stay at home all day.


[Illustration:]

  COWSLIP dearly loves to romp
  Around the bottom of the swamp;
  She comes along in early spring,
  Before the grass, or anything.


[Illustration:]

  In a shower got quite wet;
  Laughed and said she did n’t care—
  It looked like jewels in her hair.


[Illustration:]

  APPLE BLOSSOM is a fairy,
  Swinging in a tree so airy;

  Caught the dew and drank it up,
  Said cool water was so good,
  She did n’t seem to care for food


[Illustration:]

  When she came home for vacation,

  Looks as if a bit of sky,
  Had fallen down from ’way up high.


[Illustration:]

  NASTURTIUM grew so big and tall,
  He climbed up on the garden wall;
  His little sister could n’t go—
  Dear child, she never seemed to grow.


[Illustration:]

  PANSY SAID she wished she knew
  What made Lark-spur look so blue;
  Larkspur smiled and said ’t was only
  ’Cause she felt a little lonely.


[Illustration:]

  OH, HAVE you seen the sweet Briar-Rose?
  She wears the very dearest clothes,
  A hat the sweetest ever seen,
  And dainty frock all shades of green.

[Illustration:]

  He plays his tricks on young and old;
  Hides behind the old stone wall,
  And shoots his pop-gun at us all.


[Illustration:]

  RAGGED ROBIN on a lark
  Stole inside of Central Park;
  There they treated her so well,

  ALL THE SUMMER, Milkweed played,
  Like a dear, good little maid;
